# Sorting-Algorithm
The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for developers who need to sort large datasets or who are interested in learning more about sorting algorithms. Feel free to use these implementations in your own projects or to contribute new algorithms or optimizations.

## Getting Started

To use the sorting algorithms in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and import the relevant functions into your Python script. For example:

```python
from Quicksort import quicksort

my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]

sorted_list = quicksort(my_list)

print(sorted_list)```

This will import the quicksort function from the Quicksort.py file and use it to sort the my_list variable.

Current Algorithms
Currently, this repository contains the following sorting algorithms:

Quicksort: implemented in Quicksort.py
Mergesort: implemented in Mergesort.py
Future Plans
In the future, I plan to add more sorting algorithms to this repository, including insertion sort, bubble sort, and selection sort. Additionally, I am considering creating visualizations of these algorithms to help developers understand how they work and how to use them effectively.

Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request with your changes. I welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in improving the quality and functionality of these sorting algorithms.
